# Note Taker 

This application showcases a Note Taker app I made. It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to write and save notes efficiently. The app uses an Express.js back end to handle data operations, saving and retrieving notes from a JSON file. Users can navigate through the app to view existing notes, create new ones, and organize their tasks and thoughts effectively. The application is deployed on Heroku, ensuring easy access and smooth performance.
